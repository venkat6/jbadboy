JBadboy is a Java based player for Badboy scripts based on XulRunner, the
Mozilla based runtime that uses the Gecko rendering engine underlying FireFox.

JBadboy is not 100% compatible with Badboy in how it plays back scripts, however
it has a long term goal to reach very close to 100% compatibility.  You can 
help by reporting your own experience with JBadboy and, if you are knowledgable
about software development, contributing your own fixes and patches to the
JBadboy source code.

JBadboy is distributed by Badboy Software, Australia.  For more information,
