## JBadboy Limitations ##

The current release of JBadboy is an alpha quality preview release: it has many
unimplemented features and only supports an elementary subset of Badboy tools, including:

  * Requests
  * Navigations
  * Form Populators (only population: clearing and submitting forms not supported)
  * Assertions using content checks only
  * JScript items executing only in the top frame. Only a small subset of operations on the "badboy" object are implemented.
  * Steps with looping over simple variables

It is planned to implement many of the missing features in JBadboy as soon as possible.  A focus is being put on the high priority items that prevent you from successfully using JBadboy in practice.
