JBadboy is a Java based player for [Badboy](http://www.badboy.com.au) scripts based on [XulRunner](http://developer.mozilla.org/en/XULRunner), the Mozilla runtime that uses the Gecko rendering engine underlying [FireFox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/).

So far JBadboy supports a subset of Badboy script items but work is continuing to improve the breadth and depth of support.

For information on installing and using JBadboy see [the wiki](http://code.google.com/p/jbadboy/wiki/Using).
